<h2>Code to Help Plan the Floorboard Arrangement Within Home
<p>Accepts variables for Floorboard Length, Overall Row Length, Minimum Board Length. Correspondingly outputs a NumPy 2D Array of the most optimal (least wastage) floorboard lengths, with each row of the array being a corresponding row in the overall solution, and also a matplotlib graph (shown below) of a design of the floorboards, with each board colour coded. </p>
